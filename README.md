# Interactive Roadmap Project (Vite + React + TypeScript)

A Vite-powered React + TypeScript project with Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 22 (project includes `.nvmrc`). Use `nvm use` if available.
- npm (lockfile is `package-lock.json`). Yarn/Pnpm also work if you prefer.

## Install
```bash
npm install
```

## Run (development)
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Starts Vite dev server (default: http://localhost:5173).
- Supports hot module replacement (HMR).

## Build (production)
```bash
npm run build
```
- Outputs static assets to `dist/`.

## Preview (serve the production build)
```bash
npm run preview
```
- Serves the built `dist/` locally to verify the production bundle.

## Lint
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Environment variables
- Create a `.env` file if needed.
- Only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the client (e.g. `VITE_API_URL=`).

## Common issues
- Port in use: run `npm run dev -- --port 5174` (or another free port).
- Node version: ensure `node -v` matches `.nvmrc` (22). Use `nvm use`.
